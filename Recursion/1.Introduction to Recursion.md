### What is Recursion? 
The Recursion is the process in which a function calls itself directly (call in the same function) or indirectly (call other function that  function call a the first function). and  it uses LIFO structure

 Using a recursive algorithm, certain problems can be solved quite easily. Examples of such problems are [Towers of Hanoi (TOH)](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/c-program-for-tower-of-hanoi/), [Inorder/Preorder/Postorder Tree Traversals](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/tree-traversals-inorder-preorder-and-postorder/), [DFS of Graph](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/depth-first-traversal-for-a-graph/). Recursion is a technique with help of which we can reduce the length of our code and make it easier to read and write. 
### Properties 
+ Performing the same operations multiples time with different inputs 
+ In every step we try smaller inputs to make the problem smaller 
+ Base condition is needed to stop the recursion

### Implementation 
**Step 1**
Define a base case identifying the simplest case for which the solution is know
**Step 2**
Define a recursive case in which call the function recursively 
**Step 3**
Ensure the recursion terminates
**Step 4**
combine the base case with  recursive case

### Example 
Let us consider a problem that a programmer has to determine the factorial n , a simple approach is simply to multiply the numbers starting from 1 to n like this `F(n)=1*2*3*...*n`

Step 1: Define a base case 
	The base case in this example  is if we have calculate the factorial of 1 that is 1, remember that the factorial of 0 is 1 and this is a mathematical convention 
````cpp
if(n<=1) return 1;
`````
Step 2: Define a recursive case 
	The base recursive in this example  is if we have calculate the factorial of n>1 for example the factorial of 3 is 1 * 2 * 3 but the factorial of 3 too is equal 3 * 2! so we can use the same function for calculate 2! 
```cpp
if (n>1) return 3+f(n-1)
```
Step 3: Ensure the recursion terminates
	The answer is yes! because we have the case base that is 1
Step 4 
combine the base case with  recursive case

```cpp
int Factorial(n){
	if(n<=1){// base case 
		return 1;
	}else{
		return n * Factorial(n-1);
	}
}
```
