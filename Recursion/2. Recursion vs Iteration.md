| Recursion | Iteration |
| ---- | ---- |
| Terminates when the base case become true | Terminates when the condition become false |
| Used with function | Used with loops |
| Every recursive call need extra Space in the stack memory | Every iteration does not require any extra space |
| Smaller code size | Larger code size |
The choice between using recursion or iteration in a program can depend on various factors, and both approaches have their advantages and disadvantages. Complexity is not always the sole criterion to consider. Here are some reasons why you might prefer recursion despite the potentially higher apparent complexity:

+ **Code Readability:** In some cases, recursive code can be clearer and easier to understand than its iterative counterpart. Recursion often more directly reflects the mathematical or logical structure of the problem.

+ **Divide and Conquer:** Recursion is particularly useful for problems that can be divided into smaller, more manageable subproblems. The "divide and conquer" technique is often naturally expressed with recursion.

+ **Recursive Data Structures:** When working with recursive data structures, such as trees or linked lists, recursion can be the most natural way to process and manipulate those data.

+ **Less Repetitive Code:** In some cases, recursion can reduce the amount of code needed, as you can write a function that solves the problem and call it repeatedly instead of writing a loop.

+ **Conceptual Elegance:** Sometimes, recursion can provide a more elegant solution from a conceptual standpoint, even if it might have higher time complexity.

On the other hand, iteration tends to be more efficient in terms of memory usage and speed compared to recursion, as it doesn't have the associated cost of additional function calls.
