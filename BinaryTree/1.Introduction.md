### What is a Binary Tree?
A binary tree is a tree data structure in which each node can have at most 2 children, left and right child.
The top node in a binary tree is called "root" and eaach node in the tree contain: 
+ Data
+ Pointer to left child 
+ Pointer to right child 

we can representa tree node using structures or we can use classes like this 

````cpp
struct node {
	int data;
	struct node* left;
	struct node* right;
}

class Node {
public:
	int data;
	Node* left;
	Node* right;
}
````
