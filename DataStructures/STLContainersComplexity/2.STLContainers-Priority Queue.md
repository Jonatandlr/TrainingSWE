### Priority Queue
A priority queue is a type of queue that arranges elements base on their priority values, elements with higher priority values are typically retrieved before others elements that it's not 

Priority queue is used in many popular algorithms, it's the implementation of **Max Heap** by default
**Syntax:**
`priority_queue<data_type> NameOfQueue`
or we can implemented **Min Heap** 
`priority_queue<data_type,vector<data_type>,greater<data_type>> Nameofqueue`
**Complexity**
